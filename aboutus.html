            <hr class="w-25 mx-auto ms-md-0 mb-4 text-secondary">
            <p>For years, Big bites has been changing the way Indians eat. We are now on our way to transform how India lives, works, and innovates. With our actions and decisions strongly defined by the Swiggy values every step of the way, our growing universe of Swiggsters has been through all the ups and downs together. From delivering food to providing unparalleled convenience, the journey has been punctuated by constant growth and yet, we believe we’ve just begun!

                Organisations have distinct identities and values that transcend cultures and time zones. These are formed by beliefs and are derived from experiences, observations, and learnings. And the first step in creating a company culture is building a solid foundation based on core values. It is this that shapes our vision.
                
                Big bites’s Head of Human Resources, Girish Menon discusses how our values came to be, creating a guiding force that drowns out all distractions and propels us toward our mission. “One thing which has been constant is that we’ve always been an employee first company and a values driven company. The seriousness with which we went with the values, the creation of values, is impeccable. And I think that’s the bedrock of our culture today.”
                
                Big bite’s values are built on steadfast principles: to be, think, and act like a true Big biter.
                
                Before we dive into what our values mean to us, here’s what Anuj Nagpal, Director – Supply commercials, has to say about how our values are not just words on paper, but are principles that we embrace every day.
                
                .</p>
            <p>Times change quickly in an industry as dynamic as ours. The market transforms, the business landscape evolves, and people’s needs immediately reflect this dynamism. 

                As India’s leading on-demand delivery platform, there’s one thing that never changes – how we do what we do. Not only do our values bring us together in our pursuit to elevate the lives of urban Indians, they also help us celebrate individual uniqueness that makes success that much sweeter. After all, what is innovation if not the culmination of diverse ideas to arrive at the single best solution.
                
                But that’s not all. Our values also enable our Big biter to unlock growth in their own way, to chart their own path within the Big bite universe and to excel at what they bring to the table.</p>
